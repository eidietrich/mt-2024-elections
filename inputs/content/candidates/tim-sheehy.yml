  A former Navy SEAL originally from Minnesota, Sheehy is the CEO of Bridger Aerospace, a Belgrade-based aerial firefighting company. His wealth and military background make him an attractive candidate for national Republicans and he has been endorsed by Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Gov. Greg Gianforte and U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke. But, by many of those same virtues, he's a target of criticism from some in the Montana GOP. "I think Americans are feeling underrepresented,” he told Fox News Digital shortly after launching his campaign. “They're tired of a government that they don't feel is working for them."
