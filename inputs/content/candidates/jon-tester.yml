  Tester, a farmer from Big Sandy and onetime president of the Montana Senate, has long been a known quantity in the state. But he's also served in Washington, D.C. for almost 18 years, and could face stiff political headwinds this cycle.

  “I know that people in Washington don't understand what a hard day's work looks like or the challenges working families are facing in Montana,” Tester said in a statement [announcing his reelection campaign](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/22/tester-announces-2024-reelection-bid/) in February. "Montanans need a fighter holding Washington accountable."
