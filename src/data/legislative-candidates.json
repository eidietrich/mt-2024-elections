I look forward to our recommendations and my role in potentially sponsoring bills to mitigate excessively high taxes in many areas of Montana.\nSpecifically, about 20% of the residential property tax portfolio is comprised of out of state owners who are likely part time residents. Perhaps we need to bifurcate the residency category or consider a higher rate for residential taxable values but at the same time offer discounted appraisal values for full time residents. We have about 15 active tax categories, so we need to avoid substantial tax shifts as we address the inequities.\n"

I think all forms of Medicaid need to be available to eligible Montana's. Last session the legislature fully funded the medicaid reimbursement rate for providers, If the rate falls behind as has been occurring, providers cannot afford to stay in business. We must stay up to date by addressing funding needs every.\n session. In 2025 Medicaid Expansion is up for reauthorization. A very high percentage of participants are low wage working Montanan's who's access to health care is dependent on the program. Expansion keeps our very rural hospitals afloat."

          "answer": "First and foremost is the need to fix residential property taxes, so especially the middle class can afford potential increases that may occur with any substantial boost to K-12 funding. There is currently funding that addresses per/student increases up to 3% per year. To address the higher inflation rates of the near past and look at overall boost of the career earning potential of an educator, the state should be willing to provide budget authority to districts to increases through the next biennium budget of a minimum of 5%/year and provide additional state funding for the middle portion of the funding formula known as Guaranteed Tax Base. We must be aware of unfunded liabilities for pensions and study district consolidations."

          "answer": "One of the obstacles to mental health care in this state is a lack of providers. I would support a system that assists with a college education if upon graduation and with professional certification the student spent 3-5 years practicing in a rural Montana location. Rural Montanans may also face the obstacle of transportation to a medical facility. Anything we can do to improve access to a public transportation system is beneficial."

I went to work for Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. in June, 1996 in Managerial positions in Montana and retired on January 2, 2024. I graduated from Dawson County High School with the class of 1976! I have seen and experienced many sides of life, good, bad, indifferent, I have spent many years watching MT thrive and then many years not so much. I have been testifying at hearings in the MT Legislature since 2003 in order to make it easier to produce our Natural Resources and to fight against the radical Environmentalists."

It provides hard-working, low-paid Montanans access to general medical care and, significantly, care for mental illness and substance abuse when they need it.\n\nMedicaid expansion is keeping urban hospitals and clinics financially healthy and rural critical access hospitals alive.\n\nIt supports about 7,500 jobs and generates about $475 million in personal income and $700 million in economic activity. \n\nFinally, between budget savings and increased tax receipts, Medicaid expansion pays for the state’s investment.\n\nContinuing Medicaid expansion is the right thing to do for Montana’s people, healthcare infrastructure, economy and state budget."

          "answer": "The Montana legislature needs to decrease the residential property tax rate from 1.35 to 0.94 percent which the Department of Revenue advised in November 2022 and the Republican legislature and Republican governor ignored.\n\nThe Republicans’ inaction continued a trend of shifting tax responsibilities away from industrial properties, which corporations use to generate income, onto residential properties where people raise their families. This time, the residential share of total property taxes increased 5 percent and the industrial share decreased 5 percent.\n\nMontana needs to go back to asking corporations to pay their fair share."

At the end of March 2024, RiverStone Health was down $2.2 million from its anticipated Medicaid revenue. \n\nDPHHS has dropped nursing home residents, individuals in assisted living, disabled people and children from Medicaid not because they were ineligible but because they could not navigate the arcane and disorganized reapplication process.\n\nDPHHS needs a new director."

I do not think it is fair to ask taxpayers to pay for private schools on top of that. I oppose using tax money to support private schools.\n\nIndustrial properties are hard to evaluate and there is a cap on how much their taxes can increase. Residential properties are easy to evaluate and have no cap on increases. We need to look at caps and we need better ways to evaluate industrial property values.\n\nWe need to look at how we tax multi-million dollar vacation properties."

Low-income, highly industrialized areas, like parts of Laurel, need air quality monitors and better information on the negative effects of pollution on our health.\nOther issues I am concerned with include: access to and protection of public lands; raising the minimum wage; expanding Medicaid; and protecting our agricultural industry."

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "While property taxes for homeowners has risen about 20%, industry has been given a pass. Overall, large industrial taxes have fallen. As an example NWE, the state's largest taxpayer, saw a decrease of 20%, paying $36 million less than the previous year. Reform of property evaluations need to be instituted, ensuring homeowners don't shoulder so much of the burden.\nTo assist elderly and poor homeowners qualify for relief, I would support a system that automatically enrolls low-income property owners based on their state tax return."

          "answer": "Firstly, the state needs to re-enroll everyone who was kicked off Medicaid during the recent purge. Montana disenrolled more folks faster than almost any other state--adversely affecting not only the health of children and other vulnerable people, but endangering rural health centers and providers, which rely on Medicaid reimbursement to remain in business.\nGiven that the federal government pays 90% of the related costs, Montana legislators should take advantage of that, and further Medicaid expansion. "

          "question": "Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "The funding formula is extremely complex, but based primarily on the number of students enrolled in a school district, with a 3% increase every year. With inflation exceeding that number, the increase needs to at least match inflation so districts can keep up with expenses. Unlike school funding, teacher salaries are paid through the General Fund and determined by the legislature. \nI would support simplifying the formulary for funding schools and providing districts with some spending flexibility depending on their needs. The legislature needs to ensure quality educators are rewarded and should increase teacher base pay.\nNo funds for public schools should be allocated to private charter schools.\n"

I believe there should be gradual increases over time and/or caps on the increases allowed. Additionally, folks who have been in their homes for many years and are on a fixed income need to be considered. I believe there is a big difference between permanent (specifically long-term home ownership) and rental properties or short-term rentals.  We need to consider it all. "

Additionally, the needs of students continue to increase. \nRecruitment & Retention is extremely difficult, causing staffing to be at crisis levels. Looking at opportunities to increase funding to pay better and offer better benefits is critical. \nAgain, I support Early Childhood, K-12 & Higher Ed.

I am a former advisor and consultant with over 35 years of experience working with over 1,400 businesses across the country.\nA resident of Montana for over 25 years, I graduated from South Dakota State and attained several advanced degrees in business in the US and Europe. \nI have been inspired to run for office due to shifting issues. I have worked from the ground up meeting with varying individuals and groups listening to concerns. My reputation is getting business done, on time and on budget. I believe that I am the only candidate who is actively working for the people of Montana and I will do everything in my power to tilt the scales to the people."

          "answer": "From my window there are many factors that are driving the train off the track in Montana. The Legislature/Government is ignoring the people and making life more difficult for long standing residents. Changes in the tax system that rewards out of state and high-income corporations places more burdens on the everyday worker. In addition, the Legislature is extremely driven to intrude on a woman’s right to privacy and wants to make healthcare decisions on their behalf.\nI propose to back off the recent tax reductions for out of state companies and increase the tax rate on ultra-wealthy individuals. Along with this is to suspend property tax increases for senior citizens. Lastly, I would initiate protections to women, and health providers "

          "answer": "Taxes have increased 26% on average under the present administration which is more then a significant number of the population can afford. Meanwhile, the governor and Republicans decided to give away a billion dollars of the Montanan’s tax money to out of state corporations and the ultra-wealthy. In the same period, schools, county and local government have experienced inflation at levels not seen since the 1980’s.  The legislature needs to modernize the participation rate to the local government/schools which is a better use of the tax resources. I support repeal of the tax measures, lowering the rate for large taxpayers. In addition, I would insist the DOR discontinue clandestinely negotiating tax rates with the largest tax payers."

This is an embarrassing footnote for the state.\nMontana needs to renew Medicaid Expansion. If not, this could be disastrous for Montana businesses whose employees get their health coverage through this service. Not renewing this measure could jeopardize the financial solvency for our hospitals, care centers and senior living facilities and limit all healthcare service all over.\n"

          "answer": "Montana continues to slip on the commitment to education. Funding has been abysmal and Montana teachers are now the lowest pay in the nation. I propose that the state increase its funding levels to the state’s public schools. Inflation has been devastating and is only compounding the problem statewide. Many of the increase expenditures for schools benefit the state and it's only right to transfer the liability back to the state."

          "answer": "To reduce property taxes for everyday Montanans, we can implement a Housing Fairness Credit, providing relief to families with lower and moderate incomes. Coupling this with a homestead exemption would further alleviate the burden on homeowners. Instead of income tax rate reductions benefiting the wealthy, the focus should shift toward fairer taxation, like a top income tax bracket for high earners. This ensures everyone contributes their fair share, aligning with Montana values of community responsibility. Such measures address rising property taxes and promote equity and stability in our revenue system, benefiting all Montanans."

          "answer": "I wholeheartedly support Medicaid expansion as a means to enhance healthcare access. Before Medicaid expansion, there was a gap where many couldn't afford coverage, leaving them uninsured and increasing healthcare costs for everyone. Ensuring affordable coverage is crucial as the cost of living rises, impacting people's ability to meet basic needs. Access to healthcare isn't just about financial costs; it's about enabling participation in communities—working, volunteering, supporting families—that enriches society. Continuing Medicaid expansion past 2025 is essential for fostering healthier communities and ensuring everyone can access the care they need to thrive. In turn, thriving communities support productive people. "

Instead of creating a once in a generation, response & fully funding our public schools in rural, urban, and Tribal Montana, the GOP supermajority raised taxes for homeowners by $200 million & they cut taxes for all those “small business owners” you know, the one the Governor keeps talking about… like Northwestern Energy, cut their taxes by 36 million, cut Charter Communications by 1.8 million, cut Montana Rail Link by 2.8 million.

Notably, while our homes are assessed at their full market value, corporations are allowed to negotiate their values. We need to have tax fairness.\n\nSecond, we can institute a homestead exemption (which would be a reduction of the taxable value) for homeowners who reside fulltime in Montana and pay their income taxes in Montana and would not be available for those with second and third homes here. \n"

If the Legislature fails to pass this, thousands of hard-working Montanans and children will go without healthcare insurance. Our economy needs a healthy workforce, and our education system needs healthy children. Most of our rural hospitals and clinics depend upon Medicaid to keep their doors open. Medicaid is not a hand-out; it provides affordable healthcare insurance for low income workers and their families. 80% of the cost of Medicaid comes from the federal government rather than Montana. It is essential that we do not turn this federal money away at the expense of our citizens."

All residents in Montana are impacted negatively by poor physical and mental health of its residents be that by lost job productivity or citizens’ contributions to the community. Research indicates that economic effects of expanding healthcare coverage to low income Montanans would introduce $650 million into the economy each year, support 6,000 new jobs, and add $400 million in personal income. It is the job of the Legislature to enhance and improve access to healthcare services. "

Additionally, this money gets spent at local businesses and strengthens our economy. When it comes to providing more mental health, housing and general health resources, we can see data trends indicating that increasing funding to these programs results in a decrease in crime.

My husband and I moved to Montana. Both of my children were born in Billings. I had to move out of state to get my Master's in Social Work but moved back to our favorite state purposefully 15 years ago.  I just turned 70, widowed and retired.  I spent my career working in mental health crisis intervention, case management for the seriously mentally ill, and administration of non-profit mental health agencies.  I have learned to understand that things can always change for the better and how to work hard to make that change happen. "

This should be a bipartisan issue but it initially passed by only a few votes. We mustn't take it for granted. Medicaid Expansion has improved the health of our community members, of our work force, and is vital to the well being of our small rural hospitals we all depend on.  A second huge priority is fixing Montana's broken mental health system. We simply cannot do this successfully without Medicaid Expansion. Legislation in both of these areas will be coming from Legislative Leadership and I will do everything I can to help develop it and get it passed. "

          "answer": "Tax policy has been an interest of mine ever since I first ran for office eight years ago.  I have studied with experts in Montana revenue, but it is complex.  The recent bust up in property taxes could have been managed using a current mitigation process already known in the Legislature, but the Republican supermajority leadership failed to bring it forward despite prompting by the Democrat minority.  We should make that happen correctly this upcoming session. But our entire Montana tax system needs updating and correction. Our tax brackets are regressive. We need to restore the top tax brackets that were changed in 2003 and repeal tax expenditures that benefit fossil fuel extraction and off shore corporations. "

          "answer": "In the short run we must get Medicaid Expansion passed and let's get the insulin cap passed, too. In the long run, I believe we need to have a physical and mental health care system that is non profit and centrally managed as many other countries have successfully developed. In the interim, we need to fund services sufficiently, consistently and expertly rather than by a haphazard process of providing grants. I am a strong supporter of women's rights to a full range of reproductive health services and will promote access to free birth control.  Prenatal and post partum care need to be greatly enhanced. Supporting community based systems such as Community Health Centers and state employee clinics moves us towards coordinated care. "

          "answer": "As recently as 2016 half our states had not returned to pre 2008 levels of funding for education following the Great Recession. Montana's state share of higher education funding versus tuition has dropped from 76 percent in 1992 to 38 percent in 2019. The funding recipe for public schools is an attempt to balance local and state and federal funding but it is incredibly complicated. I don't think tinkering will fix it. We need to modernize our tax code as noted above, get our revenue solidified and increase the overall level of funding for the entire range of education.  Funding public pre K helps educate children and let parents work so let's make that happen.  We must target more robust aid to our schools. "

          "answer": "Born in Ironton, MO., I'm 61 & have lived in Montana for 40 years moving here after I completed my education from the State of Kansas Regent System where I attained my professional education to be a Mortician. The last 26 years I have made St. Ignatius my residence with my wife , Phyllis Haynes. We own Foster Funeral Home & Crematory with locations in St. Ignatius & Browning. We sold Browning in Nov. 2023 to make time for my wife's recovery from a liver transplant. I am an excellent candidate because like many in my district  my wife is a member of the CSKT, & our business is incorporated under the Tribe. However, since my families ancestry is from OK we follow Federal, State & Tribal laws/rules and understand how they work together."

For this reason I would advocate that the State withdraw and let the Reservations function more as Sovereign Nations under the Yakama Accord unless their is a compact or federal mandate to have the State government act in that capacity. That way the Federal Government would have address the issue and possibly could come up with a solution."

Limits to discretionary spending of funds by the recipient should be put into force that would restrict their purchasing of alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes and gaming.\nIn regards to our state run facilities which have been under scrutiny and seem to be failing we should look to see if privatization is better for them."

          "answer": "Having a father that has been a member of the State Of Kansas Regents Board, I have seen him struggle with this issue and there is not an easy boiler plate answer to it. \n Most solutions are not pleasant but consolidation is usually necessary evil & the offering of duplicate courses must be examined. Most states with populations as sparse as Montana do not have as many colleges as Montana does. As for k-12 funding it should be based upon number of students that live within a district. By doing this home school, private school, & charter school families still contribute to the solution. Also because of the amount of federal and state lands that some districts have negotiations would be appropriate to have them raise their contributions."

I have a BS in Art Ed. and a BS in Forest Science with post-grad in Outdoor Rec. from UM & Clemson U. As a F.S. employee, I connected with rural communities & learned first-hand how wildfire impacts private property. At the L&C Interpretive Center, I created programming & many public-private partnerships. I led public meetings, met with the media, and kept govt. officials informed. Starting in 2010, I served as Cascade County Commissioner for 10 years, so understand local govt. I prepared county budgets & policies and much more. All of these experiences will enable me to quickly understand legislative issues."

Corporations & centrally assessed properties are exempt from paying their fair share & seniors are being priced out of their homes. Also, personal property tax relief reduces taxable income essential for public education, mental health, and local government funding. \nThe legislature can and must do better to fund our public education system and provide incentives to increase teacher salaries.\n"

          "answer": "Unfair tax exemptions for centrally assessed properties shifted the tax burden to Class 3 properties. Property taxes have not been equalized despite DOR advice on using a previously used multiplier for calculations. The multiplier should be applied. Another idea might be a 5-10 year phased tax increase or a % exemption for first-time homebuyers and/or senior homeowners. Centrally assessed property & large corporate exemptions should be eliminated so they pay their fair share. The Ag Exemption should also be re-visited, as some property owners in high-valued recreational areas use the Ag exemption to reduce their taxes. The Personal Property tax rate should also be reviewed because equipment exemptions are too high. "

To increase access to care, FQHCs or look-alikes could provide child & adult physical/dental/mental health services through our public schools. MT also desperately needs mental health crisis facilities with residential services to stabilize Montanans in crisis & move them toward full recovery. Funding should prevent crisis patients from being “warehoused” in detention facilities where they do not receive appropriate services. Montanans deserve timely assessments so they can receive mental medical services, regain their balance, return to work and provide for their families. "

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Inflation impacts school budgets. Schools have difficulties attracting/retaining teachers & support staff. The school funding formula is fundamentally sound with the exception of not having adjusted to the increasing costs the education system is facing. The school funding formula relies heavily on the number of students. Schools with decreasing or stagnant enrollment are unable to operate without substantial operational reductions. Adjusting the formula to reduce its reliance on student numbers would be a step in the right direction. Additional state funding reducing the tax burden on property taxpayers is one adjustment consideration. Safety & technology needs should be factored in as essential components of the formula for schools."

I also see a failure of the State to provide adequate resources for mental health, and I would like to advocate for the establishment of modern mental health facilities utilizing a portion of the State's budget surplus. Health care in general needs work, and the legislature owes it to citizens to take it seriously and improve the system."

I would like to avoid increasing tax assessments on true agricultural grounds as much as possible, and reassess how Ag exemptions for parcels under 20 acres are handled.

          "answer": "As someone whose spouse was an educator, and left due to a lack of adequate resources, I will stand by the validity of the first part of this statement. I am skeptical of any proposal that diverts public funding to private institutions, and I want to advocate for adequate funding of PUBLIC education at all levels, including vocational re-training programs. I believe revenue that was intended to be directed to the public school system has been chipped away at over the years and the current level of funding is inadequate, as evidenced by the relatively low rate of teacher pay compared to other States. I think any proposal must consider impacts to rural schools with limited resources, and must set them up for success as well as urban centers."

Failure of the canal system will lead to loss of irrigation and drinking water in those counties and lead to adverse environmental impact on our fisheries and riparian areas. I will put forward a bill to fund the St Mary's Irrigation district, with legislation to address funding for future repairs, so we are not in this position again.\n Taxes are one of the biggest concerns in my district and I will not support a sales tax or a consumption tax. \n I want to also work on bills addressing censorship in media. Our First Amendment rights should not be abridged by the government or corporations.\n "

Affordable housing is more complex; a mix of proposals: such as subsides; tax incentives; Board of investments for infrastructure to lower capital start up. Property taxes is the next question."

I care about families and children. I have good problem solving skills, I'm flexible, determined, and fair. I have been at the negotiating table to bargain for fair wages and good working conditions.

The last legislature had opportunities to fix this situation and voted against them. I support ways to equalize how property taxes are distributed among commercial, utilities, and other land owners.\nOur health care system in Montana is another pressing concern for 2025. Without the renewal of Medicaid Expansion, our rural hospitals and health care system will be at risk. This decision will impact all of us. I will support the renewal of Medicaid Expansion.\nAnother pressing issue is public education. Our public school teachers are some of the lowest paid in the country. I support public education."

          "answer": "The super-majority legislature had an opportunity in the last session to correct the upcoming problem that they knew was coming to homeowners and voted against such legislation. In Montana's Constitution, it states that the state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all properties. In 2025, there needs to be serious changes so homeowners are not carrying the burden for the state. Industrial and utility property taxes decreased. I will stand up for homeowners. "

If we don't renew Medicaid Expansion, we will lose federal funding. We will see a rise in closures of medical facilities. We will see more medical bankruptcies. People will get sicker. I intend to listen to our folks who run hospitals and medical facilities in order to learn how the legislature can best serve them. \nMental health is also an area to address. We have seen a rise in mental health issues among all ages since the pandemic. Instead of cutting these programs that address these needs, I will vote to fund these programs adequately. "

Through my education in art, I learned both how to understand clearly what I observe, and how to communicate clearly through visual cues.

The irony is that we already have a state constitution that promises protections for privacy, a healthy environment and a fair tax system - a great deal can be accomplished if we stop writing unconstitutional laws, and stop wasting taxpayer money on defending them in court.\n"

We currently have an unequal tax system where only homeowners must pay the full value of their property, while businesses and corporations enjoy exemptions and rate caps. I support fully equalizing our property tax system to give tax relief to homeowners, and reducing tax breaks from utilities and businesses who are already making excessive profits.\n"

Given that Medicaid reduces the health care cost burden on individuals and small businesses, keeps children healthy and enables them to access their education, and enables more people to work and support their families, all Montanans would benefit from continuing Medicaid expansion when it returns to the legislature next year in 2025.\n"

          "answer": "Montana currently spends less per student than the national average in other states, and we have the lowest teacher pay in the nation. A well-educated community improves quality of life, creates more stable and productive local economies, reduces crime and improves public safety. In this context, the lack of adequate investment in our education is showing. Splitting dollars off for individual students to pay for private education reduces the efficiency of Montana’s already tight budget. Rather than raise taxes on working Montanans, I support placing a higher budget priority on public education without diversion to private schools through reducing tax breaks for the large corporations and equalizing our property tax formula."

I live in Lockwood, MT and am a self-employed General Contractor, developer and business owner. I have a BS in Computer Engineering and a Masters in Business Administration. I have been blessed to be born and raised in Montana. We have a special place in this world, and I appreciate all it has to offer. Growing up, being educated, working and building a business in Montana gives me a great perspective of the true needs, beliefs, and values that Montanans have and appreciate."

          "answer": "The most pressing issue facing us as a society is our financial well-being. Inflation is hurting everyone and is caused primarily by our out-of-control federal government spending. There are many important issues, but if we as individuals, and us as a state and country can’t pay our bills, the rest of the issues don’t rise above that on the priority level. Having said that, I am for tax reduction and reducing the size of the government. This is a freedom issue, because the more money and power we give to our government, the more freedoms we are sacrificing as citizens. Finally, we must work to ensure our safety through stringent enforcement of laws, particularly those that address substance use and its impact on crime in our community."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "An issue as complicated as this will not be easily resolved. The fact is that the state portion of our property taxes is a small percentage of our overall tax bill, while the majority are local taxes. The state portion of our property taxes is used to pay for schools. I would not support taking that money away from the schools. Local citizens have more control of the local property taxes, as many of those are voted on levies. The system already set by legislature is working, but the citizens have to be open to alternative ideas to tax revenue to reduce their income and property tax burden. As legislators, being open and honest with the citizens is the best way to communicate the ideas that may come forward. "

          "answer": "The Legislature has taken steps and should continue to take steps to encourage mental and physical health care providers to practice in Montana, especially rural Montana. In addition, the new medical schools in Montana are providing opportunities for home grown physicians to stay and practice in Montana, and we need to encourage more of this."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Montana’s school funding formula is unnecessarily complicated and difficult to understand. The entire school funding formula should be simplified to ensure that taxes are allocated in the appropriate manner to uphold Montana’s constitutional mandate “to provide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.” The Montana Constitution further states “The legislature may provide such other educational institutions, public libraries, and educational programs as it deems desirable.”  I am a big supporter of Career and Technical Education programs that need to be encouraged and financially supported by both the state and private industry."

Medicaid expansion needs to happen so we can cover the third of those Montanans that should have healthcare. \nWe need to revamp the process for Medicaid application and expand the system that supports it. Long wait times, and weeks on weeks waiting for determination only to be kicked off is unacceptable.

          "answer": "The funding structure we currently have and the burden it places on our local communities needs to be reevaluated. Montana's current spending per student falls below the national average, while our teacher salaries rank as the lowest in the country. Investing in education not only enhances quality of life but also fosters stronger local economies, reduces crime, and boosts public safety. However, the lack of sufficient funding for education is evident. Diverting funds to private education diminishes the effectiveness of Montana's limited budget. Instead of burdening working Montanans with tax hikes, I advocate prioritizing public education by reducing tax breaks for large corporations and revising our property tax system to ensure fairness."

However, Medicaid expansion is undoubtedly the most pressing issue heading into the 2025 session. Medicaid expansion keeps Montanans healthy & working especially those working in jobs which are critical to the economy such as childcare or other service sector jobs. I support legislation that lifts the sunset on Medicaid expansion & would also support permanently removing the sunset. Expansion keeps the doors open on our rural hospitals and keeps the uncompensated care costs down. Medicaid expansion improves healthcare for all Montanans."

          "answer": "3)\tA once-in-a-generation opportunity to fully invest in a better, affordable Montana for all was wasted when the legislature chose to prioritize significant tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent, and chose to dish out multiple one-time rebates instead of utilizing the historic surplus towards any type of long-term policy solutions. Families with the lowest incomes are paying a greater share of their income in State and Local taxes, and residential taxpayers (ie, homeowners and renters) are paying a greater share of property taxes. I support legislation that will reduce property taxes for those whose property taxes exceed a percentage of their incomes and require corporations and those with higher incomes to pay their fair share of taxes."

          "answer": "First & foremost, pass Medicaid expansion. The federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion; the state pays the remaining 10%. Expansion improves heath care access for all Montanans by providing more options for mental health & substance abuse treatments, increases services offered at Indian Health Service facilities and provides greater access to preventive care & early screenings which lead to healthier and better lives. Expansion brings in millions in new federal spending creating jobs, helps maintain a healthy workforce & promotes economic growth."

          "answer": "5)\tA strong public education system not only benefits the individual student but plays a crucial role in the development of an informed and engaged citizenry. Quality public education ensures that individuals have the tools to learn, adapt and thrive throughout their lives and strengthens communities by fostering collaboration and shared responsibility. The State needs to focus on investing more resources and money into our public education systems rather than diverting public funds to support private schools. The school funding formula is complex and does not adequately fund larger school districts. I support looking at ways to improve the school funding formula to address this funding gap."

The last legislature made progress in increasing the number of living units available, but now it’s time to work on making sure Montanans can afford what is available.

Many people in our communities are struggling with chronic disease or addiction and can’t afford care. The legislature must continue Medicaid expansion past 2025. Medicaid expansion is a great deal for Montana. It has been a crucial tool for helping many of our friends and neighbors get or stay healthy enough to work or get an education.

          "answer": "I was born in Butte, America and I am proud to live in Billings, Montana. I’ll be 41 on Election Day. I am an attorney and recently entered private practice with the firm Netzer, Krautter, & Brown, P.C. Before that I served as a public defender with the State of Montana for 11 years. My work protected everyone’s rights under the Constitution. I have been involved with the Montana Legislature for a decade, using my public sector experience and knowledge of the criminal justice system to provide testimony and bill drafting assistance. Last year I used my advocacy to pass legislation to protect children from sexual assault and to cut red tape in state government. I can bring more positive change as your next state representative from Billings."

For housing, I support zoning reform, encouraging multi-family homes, and creative practices such as accessory dwelling units and community land trusts. Passing permanent Medicaid expansion is critical for a healthy and productive workforce. It’s also the right thing to do. The State Hospital is at serious risk of collapsing. As an attorney who has represented MSH patients, I’ll use my legal experience to draft legislation for building a new system of community-based mental health hospitals to provide patients the support they need."

          "answer": "The 2023 Legislature fumbled an opportunity to stop the pandemic housing spike from spiking the property taxes of everyday Montanans, many on fixed incomes. Rather than adjust property taxes to keep homeowners from getting pinched, legislators cut income taxes for the wealthiest Montanans instead. Property taxes for railroad and mine owners have a cap as to how much their property taxes can increase each year, while homeowners do not. I support a wide range of tax reforms, such as expansion of the P-TAP program to the middle class, giving local governments more levers to generate revenue, and fixing the education funding formula to reduce dependence on mill levies."

          "answer": "The first critical priority is to pass permanent Medicaid expansion so that thousands upon thousands of Montanans are not denied needed health care. Health care reduces homelessness and improves public safety. I’ll support any reform that brings direct care to patients. DPHHS should not be denying health care for paperwork bungles or forcing rural residents to rely on phone calls to get critical care. I will also use my mental health experience and legal background to reform Montana’s broken mental heath care system, starting with Montana State Hospital and the involuntary commitment process. We can build mental health facilities that will keep patients in the community and plugged in to local resources."

          "answer": "An educated community increases public safety and improves the quality of our workforce. Montana teachers are among the lowest paid in the nation. Teacher salaries must be increased. The school funding formula should be less reliant on local property taxes and mill levies. Education funding must be a reliable and consistent component of the state budget so schools know they will be getting the resources they need and can make long-term plans accordingly. I would oppose any measures that divert money from public schools. I also strongly support increased funding for early childhood education and quality daycare. Investments in early childhood education provide children with the best chance for a lifetime of success."

          "answer": "Montana's democracy and personal freedoms are being attacked by a powerful few. I will fight for policies protecting our rights regarding medical privacy, bodily autonomy and worker's union rights. Our current property tax system unconstitutionally burdens lower income Montanans, and I propose shifting this burden back to the ultra-wealthy and large corporations. Additionally, I'll advocate for the enhancement of Medicaid, which supports low and middle income Montanans, including many indigenous people and children, and helps our rural economies with jobs in health care. Our public schools also need proper funding and fair teacher salaries; I am committed to fully supporting them and resisting the shift of funds to private charter schools."

          "answer": "Our Montana property tax system has become increasingly and unconstitutionally hard on low-to-middle-income Montana residents while providing tax cuts to large corporations and the ultra-rich. The solution is straightforward: shift the tax burden back to the groups with the largest amount of resources and influence. Currently, residential properties are taxed based on market value, whereas industrial properties owned by refineries, railroads, and telecom companies are assessed differently. This discrepancy unfairly benefits these corporations, allowing them to contribute less than their fair share. Adjusting this imbalance will make the tax system more equitable, and replenish our state fund which supports essential services for Montanans."

          "answer": "Medicaid expansion, 90% funded by the federal government, has helped rural Montana hospitals and care facilities stay open through recent economic and pandemic related setbacks. We have invested in the expansion of services due to the cost savings and bolstered our economy with good paying jobs around the state. Medicaid expansion will end in 2025 unless our elected officials renew it. We need more long-term care facilities for mental health and the aging community through additional expenditures, which are made possible by the consistent annual influx of over $900million in federal funds. Patients benefit from remaining close to their families and communities, and our aging population will be needing a lot more care in the coming decades."

          "answer": "The funding challenges are connected to the shift of the tax burden from large corporations and the ultra-rich to workers and families who simply have less money to pull from. This has had a direct impact on resources available to fund schools. We must realign the tax system to ensure fairness. Additionally, removing the 3% cap on inflationary budget increases is crucial. This allows budget adjustments to accurately reflect actual inflation rates, which were as high as 8% in recent years. Furthermore, there's a pressing need to increase state funding for special education programs, and to stop the steal of school funding by siphoning money to private charter schools who are not required to educate students needing specific interventions."

          "answer": "I have recently retired from many years of working in the health care policy, workforce development and government relations arena. I have owned a home in Red Lodge since 2000 and it became my permanent residence in 2013, after 20 years living, working and raising a family in Billings, MT. I previously had the honor of serving as the State Legislator (House and Senate) for 16 years for the Billings Heights. During my prior legislative tenure, I worked hard to listen to my constituents and focus on initiatives which promoted public education (lots of school age children in the Heights), fair taxation, small business and workforce development along with ensuring our community and residents had an effective and common sense voice"

I served on the Taxation Committees in the past, and know first hand that homeowner and small business property taxes need a rate reduction--an approach used in the past by legislature. Health care is critical to our community, as we've had several nursing home closures, and I will work on initiatives dealing with senior care, housing affordability, public education. The recent purge of Medicaid recipients will negatively impact health care for everyone, and jeopardize the financial viability for rural health care providers. "

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "As noted, during previous reappraisals, there was bipartisan support to reduce the property tax rates for homeowners and small business. This approach (although recommended in Nov, 2022) was ignored and resulted in over $200 million in permanent property tax increases for homeowners/small businesses. The blame on local governments is factually incorrect. We need to lower the rates and stop the ongoing shift of property taxes from large corporations to homeowners. Homeowners are now paying over 50% of property tax; we need to adjustthe appraisal process/valuation for other classes of property tax to ensure fairness, expand senior citizen exemptions (on property tax), include renters in our efforts and continue expanding housing."

          "answer": "First, the state needs to take quick meaningful action to requalify those eligible for Medicaid! The state leadership kicked off twice as many folks as projected; 70,000 were terminated due to the state's procedural problems. This means., forefeiting millions of dollars in Federal funding(our tax dollars). and raising health care costs for everyone. the DPHHS Director needs to be terminated. The legislature should pass legislation to renew and fund the state share of Medicaid Expansion and reinstate 12 month eligibility. The legislature, unfortunately, may need to \"micro manage\" this process; i.e. add temporary staff. We also need to expand health access in rural areas. "

          "answer": "School funding is complicated. However, coordination between OPI and local school districts (for budgeting) has suffered under the current OPI leadership and needs fixing. Next, we need to eliminate the charter school concept that is exempt from local control and stop siphong money from public schools. I would propose changes to the school funding formula to increase the state share. Also, the property tax system needs adjusting to ensure equalization. We need to provide resources for students so they can get workforce training or college credits while high school (other states do this) and consider putting more funding in programs rather than buildings.

Medicaid expansion/admin, property taxes, affordable housing, mental health, and education just to name a few. Medicaid expansion in MT sunsets in 2025, so it is imperative that the state reenrolls in that, and that we find better methods of administering access to it for Montanans that need it. We also must find more solutions to affordable housing besides reducing regulations, which many now oppose. We need to look at tax incentives for builders, developers, landlords, and towns that create truly affordable housing. I will also support sustainable solutions to finding property tax relief for many MT’s, part of which includes making sure corporations pay their share. "

          "answer": "The GOP controlled state legislature and Governor failed to sustainably address the expected rise in property taxes, resulting in MT residents paying on average 21% more than they were paying. It was well known in the legislature that the short term $675 tax rebates implemented during the session were not a long term solution, and did little to relieve the cost & anxiety Montana property owners are experiencing. Certain proposals were put forth last session that did offer tax relief for MT's but were ignored. If elected I will represent the people of Montana in finding long term solutions to restructuring our property tax system, providing relief for those that need it, while ensuring the wealthy, and big corporations pay their fair share."

          "answer": "Medicaid Expansion in MT sunsets in 2025. It is very important that the legislature re-enrolls in that program, so as a state we can afford the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans. This is also important so that mental & healthcare providers can afford to offer their services. In 2023 after the COVID era all states had to re-align their Medicaid enrollment. In MT the Governor has administered a deeply flawed process leading to over 120,000 Montanans to lose services. Some numbers: 70,000 were due to administrative reasons, Nearly 36,000 children have had their coverage terminated, 13,000 Native folks coverage terminated, including over4,000 Native children, over 7,600 seniors kicked off their insurance. This needs fixed!"

          "answer": "School funding is very complicated. Revenue comes from many sources: city, county, state, and federal, and is allocated in various ways. Currently the funding formula used by the state is antiquated, and limiting, and needs addressed. Whatever the case, it is duly noted that we need to invest more in our youth, and that the legislature really needs to look at the current formula, and actively find solutions. Being an educator for 30+ years this is an issue dear to my heart, and I look forward to working hard to find meaningful solutions. Describing possible solutions with a 750-character limit is impossible, however stating that I am devoted and dedicated to our educational systems and the youth they serve is easy!"

It has increased access to quality healthcare, leading to better health, employment and financial outcomes for Montanans. It brings millions of federal dollars into Montana, keeps our rural hospitals afloat, and creates many good paying Montana jobs. It helps children receive consistent healthcare so that problems are discovered and treated early, and it improves school readiness. It saves money by reducing emergency room visits, leaving emergency rooms available to those in acute need. I have continually fought for accessible health care for working Montanans, such as HB850 which I sponsored last session to boost medicaid coverage for Montana children."

          "answer": "We must restore property tax fairness for Montana homeowners. Last session, the Republican supermajority's policies and subsequent action by the Governor caused property taxes to skyrocket, while taxes for corporations, mines, utilities, and the wealthiest Montanans decreased. I introduced HB253 which sought to prevent these extreme increases by allowing state mills to \"float,\" so that when property values increase, mills decrease and tax bills remain relatively constant. My bill also sought to create a homestead exemption for those living in their homes, shifting the burden back to corporations and second home owners. I also supported other similar Democratic proposals. I will continue to fight for property tax fairness for homeowners. "

We must also address Republican policies which have stripped 120,000 Montanans of their health care, including 30,000 children, mostly for technical red tape reasons. To prevent this in the future, I will seek to restore \"continuous eligibility\" which was Montana policy until the Governor ended it. I sought to create continuous eligibility for children last session, which failed by one vote, so I will try again. I also introduced HB17, which sought to create Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers, to greatly expand access to mental health care. That policy is going forward and we will hopefully see results in the not too distant future. "

How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?",
          "answer": "I was born in the old Bozeman hospital and grew up in 4 corners. I am 49 and live in Big Sky, MT. I am an attorney and own my own business. I have a B.A. in philosophy and psychology. I graduated from the University of Montana's School of Law in 2002 with my J.D., with honors. I specialize in contract law and litigation.\n\nMy specialty is representing owner’s associations, which is much like the legislature. I help HOAs redraft their governing documents so that their rules actually address the needs of the community, work with government agencies on infrastructure and act as a mediator between neighbors. I will use my skills as a drafter to draft common sense laws and as a negotiator to get them passed into law."

          "question": "What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?",
          "answer": "Property taxes and affordable housing are what people want to discuss with me. I address property taxes in another question.\n\nBig Sky has a resort tax, which is partially used to fund our Community Housing Trust. Our Trust has created 52 affordable, owner-occupied condominiums, moved 111 short-term rentals into long-term, local housing, ensured seven homes will always house local workers and this summer, and will complete 25 low-income apartments for locals. The Governor’s task force identified subsidies as something that needs to be studied. I would suggest that we should look at using the bed tax, which mainly funds advertising Montana, to go to our local communities for programs like Big Sky’s Trust. "

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Over the past couple of decades, there has been a shift in the tax burden, from utilities and industries to private landowners. While residential taxes rose 30% in Gallatin County, Montana Rail Link’s share dropped 22%. It used to be that utilities and industry shared a larger share of the tax pie. I believe that we have tipped the scales too much in their favor. We must move the needle back so industry can make a profit, but not on the backs of the people."

          "question": "Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?",
          "answer": "The legislature needs to permanently fund Medicaid Expansion (or as I call it, closing the coverage gap.) The Bureau of Business and Economic Research at University of Montana has consistently found that “Medicaid expansion increases health insurance coverage and healthcare access, improving individuals’ health and household’s financial health while creating thousands of jobs and millions in income for Montanans throughout the economy.” This program provides 100,000 Montanans health insurance. That’s about 10% of our population. It is a win win for everyone and ensures that our Federal tax dollars come home to Montana as 90% of the funding is Federal dollars."

          "question": "Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Education funding formulas are incredibly complex and it is hard to make changes to them without unintended consequences. However, I believe that we need to tackle this so that schools receive funding that is adjusted for median area income and cost. Right now, there are no adjustments for the actual costs of materials, goods and for a living wage for staff. That means a starting teacher in Miles City may be paid the same amount as one in Big Sky or West Yellowstone. This simply is not equitable nor sustainable. At the same time, we need to ensure that rural schools are able to use their funding in a manner that best suits them, like making funds available to build housing for their teachers."

Taxing out-of-state second-home owners at a higher rate than single-owner in-state residents can be utilized to fund these activities and reduce the burden on residents. Additionally, I support repealing the ban on inclusionary zoning that was passed in 2021. \n\nEnergy policy - Montana stands to profit handsomely from confronting climate change. We have incredible renewable energy resources. We need legislative leadership to enact policies to hasten and facilitate the renewable energy bonanza in Montana. \n\nFairer taxation - I support relying more on income taxes as a larger source of overall funding for the state general fund.\n\nOther pressing issues below."

Relying on income taxes as a larger source of overall funding for the state general fund reduces uncertainty and can be easily structured to be fairer. I support creating additional income tax brackets for those making over approximately $125,000 to offset lowering the property rate for in-state primary residence homeowners. I also support creating a separate increased rate for out-of-state property owners, and taxing corporate and industrial property owners to levels somewhere between 1994 and now."

And, quite frankly, this states’ most important investment is our children and their education; artificial limits on that investment are short-sighted.\nFurther, we have the lowest starting salary for teachers of any state in the nation.

M. Ed. from Lesley University. \n\nIf you can be successful in the public schools, arguably the most high-stakes, unpredictable, emotionally charged, and demanding work environments in the valley, then you are well-situated to succeed on the rollercoaster that is the current MT legislature. To go further, my work experience gives me intimate familiarity with the kinds of challenges facing Bozeman residents and especially families.\n"

          "answer": "Fair Taxation: The corporate tax burden has been lessened at the expense of home owners. This must be remedied.\nHousing: While there is insufficient room to spell out the details here, we must use creativity and ambition with the levers of government to support and create housing that is affordable.\nEducation: For generations, public schools have been the engines of Montana communities. But funding has slipped over time, and without renewed investment, our children’s futures are at risk. To begin with, we cannot continue as the lowest paying state in the nation in terms of salaries for new teachers.\nEnergy: We must ensure reasonably priced, responsibly-sourced energy production. This requires confronting Northwestern Energy."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "1. We must rebalance the tax load such that corporations pay their fair share. Residential property valuations have jumped, but other kinds of property valuations have declined. Usually, there is an attempt to balance all this out, but during the last session, this did not happen. We must rebalance such that big business doesn’t get cuts at our expense. \n2. We have a significant surplus at the moment. Let’s put aside some of it specifically to serve schools. The interest would make a real difference in terms of maintaining programs and paying teachers.\n3. Localities should be allowed more room for taxing tourists. Costs in Bozeman, for instance, are astronomical. Taxing tourists means paying employees more reasonable wages.\n"

          "answer": "It is paramount that we do everything possible to take advantage of Medicaid. For the most part, this program is paid for by the federal government, and yet our leaders have recently worked to cut off this resource? According to The Daily Montanan, an astounding 127,000 Montanans, many of whom are children, were recently cut off from Medicaid. That is, they were cut off from medical support. This is the opposite of enhancing healthcare access for lower-income Montanans. If we care about Montanans, we must reverse course.\n\n\n"

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "I answered this question partially in number three. But here is more:\n\nThe legislature uses a funding formula that provides schools with funding based on 3% inflationary increases per year. But the actual inflation rate has been much higher. For example, in 2022, it was 8%. In 2023, it was 4.1%. Over time, this discrepancy means shrinking support for our schools, shrinking support that compounds. We need to have our funding relate to actual on-the-ground cost increases. \n\nAlso, the school funding formula doesn’t adjust for cost of living challenges. Teachers need more money to live in Bozeman than they need in small rural communities, for instance. We need to find a way to adjust funding for schools according to cost of living. \n"

Residents want sustainable development that doesn't unnecessarily strain our environment and natural resources. Access to quality public education from pre-k to college is also challenging for many.\nI support solutions including equalizing property tax rates to alleviate unnecessary financial burdens, voting to renew Medicaid expansion without a sunset date, making policy decisions that respect and protect our constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, and providing adequate funding to our public school districts to support future generations."

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The state has the constitutional responsibility to “appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property” (Article VIII, Sect. 3). Property taxes skyrocketed because values spiked, but the tax rates weren’t equalized during the 2023 legislative session. Since the property values increased and tax rates stayed the same, tax bills increased dramatically. I would support re-equalizing property tax rates to rebalance how much homeowners are charged without reducing the revenue collected by the state. Additionally, it is important for the state to consider the needs of the communities and factors like the cost of living when distributing funding to schools and local governments."

          "answer": "Before considering additional steps, we need to ensure that the state maintains the current support for lower-income Montanans by renewing Medicaid expansion, which is scheduled to sunset in 2025. The legislature should remove the sunset from Medicaid expansion because it is a program that has proven to bolster local economies, support healthcare providers, and keep Montanans healthier than they would be without it. Additionally, our state needs to ensure that Medicaid adequately reimburses providers for the services provided so that providers can stay open. Continued investment in our healthcare system that allows for accessible meaningful mental and physical healthcare services is essential."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Education leaders are correct. The current cap on annual inflationary increases is lower than the inflation rate. I support adjusting the funding formula to keep up with inflation and ensuring that our teachers receive competitive wages that allow them to live in the communities where they teach. \nPublic education is not just a policy issue for me-it's personal. I wouldn't have had the opportunities I've had in life without the public education system in our state. I am dedicated to supporting policies that guarantee public funding is directed towards public schools, that families can access affordable early childhood education, and that post-secondary education remains accessible to residents while supporting a sustainable labor force."

We need to reduce the overall tax rate, require MDOR to equalize properties as required by law, and provide additional relief for people on fixed incomes.\n\nAffordable Housing. The housing authority statute needs to be modernized (it was written in 1935) and additional government solutions to housing in support of local government need to be devised. The current market centric solutions are not working\n\nMedicaid Renewal is a must, as it stabilizes rural hospitals, enhances employment, reduces overall health care costs, and  is a good deal for the state\n\nWe need to re-pass, and overide a veto if necessary, legislation making it easier for seniors to stay in their homes.

NWE needs to pay more and you and me less.\n\nThat said, the simplest solution would be to reduce the overall tax rates as MDOR proposed in 2022.

State law needs to be more explicit in remedies such as recall guidelines and bonding requirements for when our elected officials act outside of their enumerated powers or fail to fulfill their duties of office. Transparency in the law-making process and financial expenditures is needed to illuminate wasteful spending; mandated online annual reporting is needed. Property tax increases need to be capped to no more than 10% in any one year and property tax relief given to the elderly on fixed incomes."

          "answer": "Taxation should never be separated from expenditures. Every school and state department should post online their current request for funding, their current funding sources and amounts and their past three years of expenditures. Each department should have a published statement on what their main function is; expenditures outside of the main focus would then become obvious as financials are also published. A state-funded task force of business experts could be utilized to help each department or school district find efficiencies through technology or innovative restructuring. "

          "answer": "The current health-care system in America is broken and in need of critical scrutiny. The unhealthy monetization of disease treatments needs to be abolished. Freedom to choose medical care should be enhanced and barriers to innovative healthcare delivery removed such as obstacles to subscription services by family doctors. Fraud in the Medicare system needs to be aggressively prosecuted as well as price gouging by pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies.

          "answer": "Education delivery has not kept up with technology and needs to be rethought. Parents consistently support more choice in education opportunities such as homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, vocational and public schools. Public schools may better serve as education centers that parents can choose what their child needs from a variety of services. Better use of current facilities to serve growing student population should be considered. Allowing for schools to hire teachers from professional backgrounds without teaching certificates would help alleviate teacher shortages. Efficiencies may be gained by regulatory relief on required administrative positions. "

The legislature along with the governor need to use the tools at our disposal to adjust tax rates so corporations pay their share. Education funding is a disaster. We need to include a cost of living allowance into our formula for districts that are in high cost of living communities in Montana.

The concept of quality education has been manipulated to leave us with a system that is struggling to meet the basic needs of our students. The cost of living in MT has changed over the years and the difference in cost of living across the state is now disparate. The school funding formula has no way to account for that and it is past time to do so. In addition, the cap on inflationary increase for school funding has effectively caused education funding to fall farther and farther behind! We must fix both of these problems in the next session."

I finished my professional career working at the local community bank, retiring after 33 years in 2020.\nI have always been associated with the Agriculture industry, and this has provided for a wealth of knowledge and experience.

I am a small business owner, Blacktail Appliance Repair, where I repair appliances for people in our town. I have a degree in Animal Science from the University of Georgia, class of 1999. I have worked for both large corporations and small businesses and also been self employed.

          "answer": "Property taxes are the most important thing to most people right now. To address this we need to do several things. First, fix the broken assessment process. Property values have gone up but in many areas the assessed value is too high. Also, we must keep our spending in check and keep the budget with little to no growth. This will allow the state to drop some of the mill rates that are applied statewide. Also, the cities are going to have to work on their budgets, this is where a lot of the property tax money is going. There are laws that can be passed to curtail some of the rapid growth for certain parts of the population, we can put a cap on property assessment growth on certain age groups."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The property assessment process needs to be reformed. In many cases the values were way over actual market value. Also, once the budget is looked and and curtailed wherever possible we can lower some of the mill rates that are state wide. Also, there can be some caps on rapid increases in market value to certain segments of the population. For example, a retired couple that has lived in a hosue for 30 years could have a max allowable increase (on a percentage basis) per assessment period."

          "answer": "Since this is not a constitutionally prescribed job of the state government much of this is dependent on budget and available money. Although the money spent on these programs usually ends up saving the state money in certain instances because it oftens falls on law enforcement. We have almost completely eliminated state run mental facilities. We must bring those back for the safety of people struggling with mental health issues and the safety of the communities. In dealing with physical health, the state should promote a healthy lifestyle with incentives and credits on health care to encourage people to live healthier lives.  "

          "answer": "The Montana State Constitution says that the state will provide a quality public education to all students to allow them to prosper in adulthood. I believe that our school systems are adequately funded. Many schools have a hard time with budgeting and cannot operate withing their means. They have a bloated payroll and are not operating an effecient school system. Many need better management."

I am the former owner-manager of Madison Lumber Company in Ennis and am currently employed as a Contracts Administrator in the oil and gas industry.\nI am a hard working farm kid, and have learned through business and community activism the importance of community. I can communicate effectively across the political spectrum.\nI was selected as an intern at Montana's Constitutional Convention. I have lobbied the Montana Legislature for the Montana Women's Lobby, the Montana Building Industry Association and the Montana Ambassadors. I understand the legislative process.\n"

There also must be a cap on the percent allowable for appraisal increases in an annual cycle.\nOur ability to make personal health care decisions is under attack. I will defend the Right to Privacy as afforded to us by the Montana Constitution.\nThe influx of out of state residences has inflated housing costs beyond the means of average Montanans. Affordable Housing is a legislative priority. I propose incentives for affordable housing projects and employer sponsored housing. I also propose fees on new construction assessed proportional to the value with such fees supporting incentives and subsidies"

Expansion of health coverage, whether public or private, to include mental health services is critical for mitigation and prevention of accompanying issues, addiction, partner or child abuse, and a host of personal and community risks.\nI believe that health care is a human right, and although I support a single payer health care plan not tied to employment, that is an issue for the US Congress. Whatever can be done to promote the health of Montanans and assure the reliability and affordability of health care access is an important, if not the most important, priority for government leaders."

          "answer": "The school funding formulas must include allowances for personnel cost of living increases and service costs such as fuel and facility maintenance., and proposals for adjustment should be considered and adopted. I would support a review of components included in mill value establishment.\nCoal tax and marijuana fees are earmarked for education and community infrastructure. I would oppose diverting earmarked educational revenue sources to the general fund or used for government agency operations.\nAssuring our children receive a quality education is a priority for the Montana Legislature. Public schools are the lifeblood of our communities. I will support policies which enhance our schools and oppose policies which detract."

          "answer": "Property taxes are necessarily high in Montana because we are one of a handful of states that do not have a statewide sales tax. (We do have “resort tax” in a few areas of the state.) Most states rely heavily on sales tax, which is shared across all consumers, as opposed to property tax which is only levied on property owners. We are leaving a lot of revenue on the table by not having a statewide sales tax that would be collected on not only our 1.1 million residents but also our 12 million nonresident visitors. I think we should evaluate the pros and cons of a statewide sales tax."

          "answer": "One of the tricky issues to be addressed on school funding is the fact that the cost to educate a student varies across the state, but the formula allocates the same amount for each student. Determining the school districts that need more support and those that can afford a lower dollar amount per student would be helpful for the next legislative session where the decennial school funding formulas will be reviewed and revised."

Not only does Medicaid Expansion allow hundreds of thousands of Montanas security regarding their health insurance, it also provides tens of thousands of Montana kids access to pediatric care. Medicaid also ensures that rural hospitals across Montana are able to keep their doors open to provide lifesaving care. I was working in the Montana Legislature in 2019 when Medicaid Expansion was first passed -- and let me assure you, it was not passed easily. It required political acumen in order to secure the vote of moderate republicans and an acute understanding of the process. "

          "answer": "To lower taxes on residential property, the Legislature should rebalance the property tax system by making sure corporations and businesses pay a fairer share of the property tax burden. One way to do this would be to provide a \"homestead exemption\" for individual property owners. This would exempt some part of the homeowner’s market value from taxation, lowering the residential property tax burden for homeowners and increasing the costs that corporations and businesses have to pay.

          "answer": "Most, if not all, public schools in our state are massively underfunded. In order to better and more sustainably fund our public schools, I would start with revising our tax structure to place more responsibility on the wealthiest Montanans and the multi-million dollar corporations doing business in our state. Additionally, I would restructure how recreational marijuana tax is being distributed within our counties – taxing higher and sending more to our public schools. Further, I would have a much larger discussion about how the hundred million dollars received annually by the Montana Lottery is being allocated out of the general fund. "

          "answer": "I was born, raised, and educated in Helena, Montana. I currently reside in Helena with my wife, Virginia, and our two daughters. I will be 46 on election day. I work as a software engineer and data analyst for an accounting and business advisory firm. I graduated with a B.A. in computer science with a minor in political science from Carroll College. I served on the Helena Public Schools Board of Trustees for six years, from 2017-2023. I served as Board Chair for three years, from 2019-2022, and chaired the Budget & Finance, Facilities & Maintenance, and Policy Committees at various times during my tenure. I served on the Montana School Boards Association Board of Directors from 2017-2023, and served as President in 2021-2022."

          "answer": "The Montana Legislature must ensure that our public school funding formula fulfills Article X of the Montana Constitution, which begins \"It is the goal of the people to establish a system of education which will develop the full educational potential of each person.\" While our students and their families are very well served by Montana's public educators and locally governed school districts, mounting evidence suggests they are struggling to meet the needs of their students with the available resources. We have a moral and constitutional imperative to invest in our children's education, and the failure to do so will also undermine economic growth and opportunity. The next Legislature must bolster our investment in Montana's children."

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Montana families are understandably concerned about the drastic increase in their residential property taxes which have substantially outpaced inflation. However, we must recognize that property taxes are a critical source of investment in public education and many other public goods. Article VIII of the Montana Constitution diagnoses the problem and compels the solution: \"The state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the manner provided by law.\" Our current system places an unfair burden on residential property owners. The next Legislature must ensure that we equalize residential home valuations with corporate and other business property classes."

          "answer": "The Montana Legislature joined 41 other states in 2015 to expand Medicaid coverage, which has enabled many Montanans in low-income jobs or part-time work due to disabilities to afford healthcare. By providing access to mental and physical healthcare services, more Montana children were able to attend school and learn while more people were able to continue working to support their families. Furthermore, the vast majority of the costs are paid for by the federal government. Investing in the health of our low-income children and families is not only a moral imperative, but a widely acclaimed policy to bolster our economy and reduce state expenditures. The next Legislature must renew Medicaid expansion."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Public school districts across Montana are facing growing budget deficits while doing their best to support and educate our children, an increasing number of whom are struggling with poverty, isolation, and pandemic related learning loss. We must ensure that our state funding formula is addressing the growing needs of our students while keeping pace with the increasing costs of meeting their needs. Article X of the Montana Constitution provides that \"Equality of educational opportunity is guaranteed to each person of the state.\" Our funding formula must therefore acknowledge that some students will need more services than others to reach their full potential and provide resources accordingly to the public schools that serve them."

I'll push for policies ensuring quality healthcare for all, regardless of income. Extending Medicaid beyond 2025 is crucial, especially for vulnerable populations like children.

Our current school funding formula falls short, hindering schools from keeping up with rising costs. Last session, I proposed removing the cap on inflation adjustments to enable schools to budget more effectively. Moreover, I will advocate for a thorough review and reform of the funding formula to better cater to student needs. Increasing state investment in education is vital, including funding for smaller class sizes, teacher training, and technology access. Our public schools are the bedrock of our society, and it's imperative we prioritize their funding for all children's benefit, regardless of background."

After traveling abroad and learning more about the relationship between indigenous people and government, I pursued a law degree at U of M to better understand how public policy impacts real people. I've continued to push for fair government since the day I graduated, first for the MT Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, then the ACLU, and now through my own small business helping non-profits achieve public policy goals."

The legislature did nothing last session to provide that support.\n\nFully funding public education. Again, the legislature missed an opportunity to bolster our public education system last session. We need to change the funding formula to increase public education resources and listen to school districts about their needs. \n\nMedicaid Expansion must be reauthorized and revised to ensure DPHHS doesn't continue to kick thousands of Montanans off their healthcare. \n\nThe state legislature also needs to mind its own business and end their attacks on LGBTQ+ people abortion rights.

Supporting legislation that expands Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) will empower Montanans with more direct control over their healthcare expenses.

The Governor paid $2m for a contractor to make recommendations to improve the workplace at the State Hospital. Very few recommendations have been implemented to improve the situation. DPHHS has not been paying local community healthcare providers for both healthcare and mental health services already provided, delaying the payments so community providers are being forced to close their doors. Protecting these community-based services should be a top priority for the legislature. We have worked for years to place services in local areas to improve access and need to keep them."

          "answer": "The Montana Legislature must increase state funding of schools and address the needs of both rural and urban schools in the new funding formula. The percent of state funding of schools has gone down over the last many years which requires local mill levies to increase dramatically just to maintain current levels of programs. Investing in a sustainable funding mechanism will allow schools to provide quality educational experiences to kids all over Montana. We also need to pay our teachers better, keeping our Montana educated teachers here rather than losing them to other states. A statewide teacher salary schedule could address this issue."

My legislative experience combined with my Financial Services and an Owner/Operator of a Cattle, Hay and Grain business in the Helena Valley gives me a wide array of knowledge and network of people to call on for assistance in vetting bills."

I am very optimistic that the Governor's Property Tax Task Force will be able to identify various problems our communities face with budget needs and be able to provide solutions and relief to the fixed and low income, elderly and disabled Montana Veterans."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The system is set by Legislature but the system is created with input from many stakeholders. It has been many years since the manner in which property taxes are calculated, has seen significant reform. \nI've lived in Montana all of my life and I believe during the last 7-10 years, our landscape, houses and rural lands has changed the most drastically. Due to increased demand to live in the 406 area code, real estate prices have driven up values and market values are what drive the equation. It is time to change the equation. It is past time to change the equation. Voters in my district were hurting before the market drove up the property taxes. In 2023 session, we increased funds for tax relief and expanded eligibility for the programs. "

          "answer": "In my three sessions, I feel as if we have gained ground each session in addressing the needs of those needing mental and physical health care services. Is it ever \"enough\" ? Unfortunately no, but the Legislature will continue work on this issue, as we do all others. In 2015, the Legislature passed the HELP Act (Medicaid Expansion), and in 2019, passed the continuation of Medicaid Expansion. It will be on the Agenda again this session. The big push will be to either renew or delete the sunset. Also added in 2019 were work requirements and other measures to help prevent fraud. I think Medicaid Expansion does allow lower-income people to receive health care access."

This would decrease the portion of property taxes paid by Montanans and shift some of the burden to out-of-state residents.

The program not only serves Montanans in need, including children and seniors, but also sustains many of our small rural hospitals. Without reauthorization of the program, many of those hospitals will not be financially sustainable, creating additional barriers to healthcare for thousands of Montanans."

          "answer": "Presently local taxing authorities are limited to increasing their budgets by one-half of the rate of inflation. Wages and benefits can not be sustained when budgets don't keep pace with inflation, leading to staffing reductions and difficulty recruiting and retaining staff. Ultimately, services are impacted. To sustain budgets and reduce the burden on residential property tax payers the legislature needs to rebalance the tax burden among the sixteen classes of property, reducing the residential property tax burden. Montana's three propert tax assistance programs, the PTAP (Property Tax Assistance Program), the Elderly Homeowners' Credit and the Disabled Veterns Program need to be expanded to serve more Montanans in need."

In the past two years, twelve Montana nursing home have closed due to low reimbursement rates making them financially unsustainable. Due to the rural nature of so much of our state it is also imperative that access to telehealth be expanded, particularly with regard to behavioral and mental health."

          "answer": "Montana's beginning teachers' salaries rank 51st in the nation (less than all fifty states and Washington D.C.) Recruitment and retention of teachers is increasingly difficult given the cost of housing in Montana's urban settings. State revenue from resource extraction and income taxes (not property taxes) must be devoted to enhancing the state budget for education. In 2023 we had a state budget surplus in excess of one billion dollars; as a result of our expanding economy we are currently on pace to have a surplus of $785 million in January of 2025. More resources must be allocated to rectify our failure to adequatey fund K-12 education and the Montana University System."

We are almost 35 trillion dollars in debt, we have a federal government who is filled with career politicians, we have a state that refuses to hear the petitions of 38 out of 56 counties who said that our property taxes are too high. There's widespread fraud, waste and abuse of tax money; and that same government who takes an oath to defend our constitution, openly violates it. Montana needs to band together and hold our federal and state governments accountable, while passing legislation that protects our elections, our sovereignty, our money, our families, our privacy, our resources and our right to be left alone.

I signed a constitutional initiative a few years ago to put a cap on property taxes because of this exact problem. It should have been put on the ballot, but because the Montana Supreme Court killed it, we are faced with a government who demands more from us every year. Government spending must be decreased by law in support of the people. If the budget in years past worked, why can it not work now? The argument of population growth or inflation does not hold weight when last year we had a surplus of 2.5 billion dollars in taxes. "

That is why it is called the \"free market.\" Government should not partner with private health insurance companies because the merging of government and corporate powers, according to Benito Mussolini, is fascism. No additional steps should be taken by our state legislature until there can be a guarantee that our tax dollars are not being wasted. The private, free market should be protected and encouraged to offer competitive health insurance options to all socioeconomic classes in Montana. If any laws are to be passed to enhance health care access, it would be to protect individuals who use cost sharing health co ops (instead of insurance monopolies) from abuses.  "

We need to take ownership of our families (I have two boys, ages 3 and 1.5) and raise them to love the Lord with all their hearts, souls, minds and strength, and to love their neighbors as themselves. We need to encourage active participation of school board elections and meetings, and we need to make sure that our tax dollars follow the child, no matter if that is to a public school, charter school, or homeschool. There does not need to be any increases in public school funding.   "

He always said, “If there is a job, just do it!” My rural upbringing, my years as an educator, parenting and advocating for environmental, social and education issues has helped me prepare to serve in the Montana State Legislature. These experiences have served me well the past three terms. I show up, advocate for my constituents and work collaboratively. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve Montana and do this important work. "

As a member of the Education Budget Sub Committee, I will work towards providing a budget that addresses inflation to the agencies we oversee, and I will advocate for crucial programs within these specific agencies to make certain they remain and are secure. As we navigate budgetary decisions, I will support adequate funding for government services including public education, health, and corrections. "

          "answer": "During the 2025 legislative session, the legislature will have an opportunity to design an equitable tax policy. Over the past decades and most recently with dramatically increasing home valuations, the tax burden has unfairly shifted to Montana’s residential property taxpayers and other taxpayers with low and moderate incomes. Opportunities include a special option sales tax, tax credits for qualifying families, consideration of a homestead exemption, and carefully analyzing residential property reappraisals. As lawmakers, we need to create equitable property tax classifications, we need to eliminate income tax reductions, and we must create a top income tax bracket to shift some tax responsibility to the wealthy. \n"

As of June 2023, 328,538 Montana citizens were enrolled in Montana Medicaid. Medicaid Expansion has kept health care accessible for all Montanans including children, covers preventive services to identify health issues early, provides needed behavioral health services and ultimately has kept people working. The state budget benefits with the federal government providing approximately $900 million into Montana annually. Medicaid strengthens the health care sector, keeps services available in urban and rural Montana communities, and supports new economic activity. \n "

The Decennial Study of school funding will occur in the interim after the 2025 legislature and will assess the educational needs and costs related to the basic system and make recommendations to the 2027 legislature. This delays needed support that our school districts would benefit from sooner than later. In 2025, I will work with educational leaders across the state as we navigate the proposed budgets for opportunities to enhance funding at all levels of the Montana Education system by working to remove or increasing the inflationary cap and by keeping public dollars in our public schools.

Young Montanans must move out of state to find good paying jobs and affordable homes, as people with high salaries and large retirement accounts from the East Coast, West Coast, and big cities (who can work from anywhere) are buying up properties and driving up home and land prices in the state. Many small businesses are losing their employees, in part, because those workers cannot afford housing in some regions of Montana. \n I would propose tax breaks and waiving of building permit fees to businessmen who build housing units for their employees. \n\n2)Rising Taxes.

When business owners spend less time on government red tape, they have more resources to expanding & improving business, leading to more job opportunities = more workers, more tax base.\nThe legislature should consider a tax on the purchase of luxury items .

I will always vote in support of a women’s right to control their own body, health care and family planning.\n\nHousing is another pressing issue, and I think the government can play a role in making housing more affordable. Solutions range from zoning changes to subsidizing or underwriting affordable housing projects with loans, grants or other incentives.

          "answer": "I am a 59 year old, third generation Montanan living with my spouse and family in Missoula. Born and raised in Great Falls, I worked on farms and ranches while in high school and college. I am a University of Montana graduate, with a degree in Computer Science and had a career in software development and as CIO of various leasing and business finance related companies. Before being elected to the legislature, I volunteered for the boards of a multitude of civic, non-profit, agriculture, childhood and education related causes in Missoula. As licensed foster care parents, we have cared for as many as seven kids in our house ranging from the age of four to sixteen. This width and breath of life experience is what I take to the legislature."

          "answer": "The issues that most people are talking to me about are property taxes, abortion, public education, and the environment. Property taxes: Legislators had ample time and opportunity to fix the personal property tax debacle we currently find ourselves in, but the governor’s office instead chose to send out rebate checks instead of fixing the problem. Thankfully, Montanans saw through the charade and voiced their strong opposition. Legislation is needed to adjust personal property tax rates. Abortion is healthcare and needs to be fully protected in our state constitution. Public education needs to be properly funded as required by our constitution. Global warming is a threat to Montanans' lives and livelihoods and should be our next priority."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Many businesses and corporations actually received tax breaks this last legislative session due to the ongoing tax shift from businesses and corporations to the homeowner. Property tax rates have recently shifted where 60% of the burden is now on personal property owners and 40% is paid by businesses and corporations. This used to be reversed, making home ownership much more difficult for working families. I hear the argument that if businesses pay more taxes, they will just pass the cost along to the consumer. I feel consumers can better manage their personal finances by cutting out non-essential purchases and services, but what can someone on a fixed income do to lower their tax bill? Sell their house? I don’t think that is a solution."

          "answer": "Expand Medicaid enrollment - Medicaid expansion is critical for the healthcare of many Montanans and is especially important in rural communities that run the risk of losing medical services if the legislature does not act. The Federal government covers 90% of the cost - this is not a difficult decision."

          "answer": "As an 11+ year school board member and a product of our public schools, I understand many of the challenges schools face. If we want to retain high quality educators, they need to be paid a living wage. I wonder why some legislators claim they support increased teacher pay and school funding, then turn around and vote against it. The state needs to fully fund public education and stop diverting public funds to private schools. We should allow public schools to be included in the state insurance fund. We need to elect a state school superintendent that stops undermining our school system and will prioritize public education."

They are rife with mismanagement and fraud which result in higher costs. Without government restrictions, treatment and medicines would be much cheaper. High quality care can be maintained if doctor and hospital performances are published instead of being shielded by the Board of Medical Examiners. COVID proved that we can bring effective and safe medicines to market without the long and costly process currently in force.

          "answer": "Throwing more tax money at schools will not solve the problem which is not so much the amount of money available as it is the way that money is spent. Schools with falling enrollment and/or performance should be merged or closed. The administrative burden on schools should be reduced so that we can focus on teachers. Maintenance should not be put off until it is critical and expensive. Schools should be required to report on scholastic performance and how our taxes are being spent.

          "answer": "I am 55 years old, I was born in Butte, MT and was raised in Anaconda MT. I have lived in Missoula, MT since 1987. I have been a primary school teacher in Florence, MT for the past 30 years, with a masters degree in education. My job as a teacher requires me to be a good listener, be a problem solver and treat all people with respect. In addition to my educator duties, I am currently the president of my local union, I have served on the negotiations committee and I was the chair of our Child Assistance Team. I believe my ability to work effectively with people in a wide variety of situations qualifies me to be an effective legislator. As a life-long MT resident, I am invested in our state with my whole heart. This is my forever home."

          "question": "What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?",
          "answer": "The believe the most pressing issue for the 2025 legislative session is the reality that many Montanans can't afford to live in our beautiful state. As a legislator, I would propose and support legislation that requires all MT residents to pay their fair share of taxes and state government is held accountable for how our tax dollars are being spent. The money our state collects in taxes must be spent wisely. As legislators, we must not pass laws that are unconditional or have unconditional elements that send us down the path of litigation. Dollars spent on legal fees should instead be allocated for increase in salaries for our law enforcement officers, fire fighters and to support our veterans along with lowering property taxes. "

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "I believe we have to make changes on how Montana funds public schools to help decrease our property taxes. The Montana Constitution guarantees that all students receive a fair and quality public education. The basic entitlement for all schools needs to be increased by using state funds. While the push for charter schools may increase opportunities for some students, inevitably our state will not be able to adequately support our public schools. With increased state funding, schools won't need to run levies, therefore reducing the tax liability of our residents. I believe a primary residence should be taxed at 75% of the assessed value. We should encourage more film making in MT and negotiate a portion of proceeds to fund the tax base."

          "answer": "A healthy Montana is a great Montana. Health care access should not be a privilege but a right for all Montana residents, regardless of their financial status. I believe the legislature and other government leaders should work together to ensure our residents can access medical care through ride share vouchers to clinics, offer incentives to healthcare providers for working in the most rural parts of our state, especially our reservations, and help with getting medications at a lower cost. We need to hire more health care advocates that also provide information and support on how to live a healthy lifestyle. "

          "answer": "A public school education is the greatest equalizer we have. The Montana school funding formula needs to be changed. As an educator for the past 30 years in a K-12 school, I have witnessed first-hand the repercussions of inadequate school funding. As I mentioned before, we need to ensure all Montana residents are paying their fair share of taxes. We need to eliminate unnecessary spending of our tax dollars. I believe we should research the idea of a state wide salary schedule for educators to attract quality applicants.  Furthermore, the state needs to institute a policy that they will reimburse the cost of a grant writer for each school (K-12, college/universities and vocation education program). "

Fortunately, there are good policy solutions for each.  These include: lifting the sunset on Medicaid expansion, passing the Housing Fairness Tax Credit, changing the inflation caps on school funding, and strengthening renters' rights and emergency rental assistance programs.\n\nI also believe that our mental health care system is at a crossroads in terms of caring for people in crisis or turning our backs on them. These solutions will be longer-term but we nonetheless must start now."

This tax credit, similar to the existing Elderly Homeowner's Tax Credit, provides an income tax refund to individuals who pay more than a set percentage of their income in property taxes.\n\nI believe this is a good solution because it does not change the amount of revenue collected by local governments, and also targets the tax relief to low-income Montanans who need it the most. It avoids the pitfalls of other proposals which end up being another tax cut for the very wealthy, and also makes sure that schools, counties, and communities continue to thrive."

It has been a crucial and effective program for Montanans for a decade and we need to stop treating it as a political football. Second, we must continue to adjust the Medicaid provider rates so that healthcare workers are paid appropriately and we can recruit and retain a robust healthcare workforce. Lastly, we need to invest in community-based mental and behavioral health - everything from local nursing homes to substance use disorder treatment to in-patient mental health beds. We need to stop relying on the State Hospital and our jails to provide crisis care in the state.\n"

In 2023, the legislature reduced the income tax rate. Manipulating the income tax rate has destabilized the property tax rate causing a significant increase. $2.6 billion in budget surplus does not reflect a balanced budget. House Bill 212 gave additional business property tax exemptions. Meanwhile we saw a significant increase in property taxes. Tax relief in other places was placed on the backs of property owners. Increase property tax trickles down to increased rent in areas already suffering from limited affordable housing. "

          "question": "Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?",
          "answer": "Crisis response teams embedded in City Fire and Police often serve and interact with non-resident people. The funding for these services need to be offset with state funds, potentially from the $2.6 billion dollars in budget surplus. Funding crisis response teams enables mental health to be properly addressed at the scene and reduces the amount of times the police need to detain or hospitalize people during a mental health crisis, thereby lowering over all cost to the tax payers.

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Funding pre-k allows parents to return to the work force earlier, increasing the economic stability of the community and the household, and thereby adding to the income tax paid to the state. It also provides earlier structured education to the children of all income brackets, that currently might not be available to children in lower income households. "
